                    <p>The 2016 Human Development Index ranks Angola 149 out of 186 on the poverty scale, as poverty permeates the entire nation. This results in a serious problem in the budget of primary schools. The primary schools are not budgeted, and schools simply lack the means to support the maintenance costs like purchasing cleaning supplies, paying for the cleaning staff, as well as water for water tanks. Because of this, the toilets are not prioritized. Open air defecation puts children at great risk. They must walk far away from the school for a decent toilet and are subject to abuse as well as animal bites. Defection close to school is a form of protection, but it is shameful. This is also the reason why girls at a menstrual age miss classes: due to the lack of appropriate areas for hygiene. </p>

                   <p>The “WASH” document made of UNICEF states that 32% of schools defecate in the open, 18% in pit latrines, 47% in latrines with a septic tank, and 2% are connected to a sewer system. (Look at the table over for a more specific analysis). </p>

                    <p>To illustrate this issue, we have made up a girl named Adrisana. She has just turned 12 years, and just got her first menstruation. She lives right outside of Luanda, the capital of Angola, Africa. At first, she does not understand what is happening. She thinks there is something seriously wrong with her. She bleeds, without knowing how to stop it. Her first thoughts are to find a room where she can fix this, like a toilet. But her school do not have real toilets, only pit latrines outside, where people can see her. She feels the shame just by the thought of sitting above the pit latrine and trying to clean herself.</p>
                   <p>The Orange Rooms goal is to make life easier for girls like Adrisana, even on places with no connected water systems. We have designed an <em>orange booth</em>, similar but sturdier and larger in size than your typical portable "festival toilet", mainly constructed from sturdy, polyethylene plastic. With high servicability in mind the booth is easy to build and deploy, and when needed - or told to when the booth <em><a href="solution.php">phones home!</a></em> - easy to recoup, clean and refill; this all administered by the Orange Room team and our local agents and partners. It is only available for youth that menstruates. Inside there is a type of vending machine, where the girls can have whatever sanitary product needed. There will be an available bench and a supply of water for cleaning hands etc. delivered by a semi-closed 20 Liter source-to-sink tank-system. </p>
                   <p> If Adrisana had The Orange Room at her school, the solution of her problem would be simple. She would get “The Orange Room card” from a responsible teacher, that would give her access to the orange room. The Orange Room would be placed close to the school, and inside she would have paper, sanitary products, underwear, antibac and water. Everything needed to fix herself up. She decided to go for the tampon - <em>because it is simple</em> - and it will not show if she wants to pee at the pit latrine later on, and people walk by. Beside the vending machine, there is a “how to”-poster, with a cartoon on how to use the different products. She would clean herself up, use a menstruation product, and go on with the rest of her school day within minutes. </p>
