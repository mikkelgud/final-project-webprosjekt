                    <p>Orange Room is a student-driven, non-profit founded  to end period poverty for pupils in elementary school in developing countries.  </p>
                    <p>Our goal is to make initiatives and organizations addressing menstrual health, just like Orange Room,  unnecessary, and until then we will work to provide a safe environment for pupils to care for themselves with dignity and empower pupils about menstrual health. </p>
                    <p>Our solutions should feel like a safe environment for everyone, and we aspire to ensure this by designing with accessibility in mind. Got feedback? Contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@orangeroom.com">contact@orangeroom.com</a>.</p>
