                    <q>At its worst, there are no toilets at all. In some schools, there may only be a small room for both girls and boys, where there is only a hole in the floor.</q>
                    <p>-Ellen Sandøe <br/>Child Rights Education manager in UNICEF Norway</p>
                    <p>Menstruation is one of the most natural things a human can experience. People all over the world has it, and still, it is a globally stigmatized issue. Not only is it taboo to talk about, but it is also tough for many people to go through.</p>
                    <p> 1 in 10 menstruating pupils in Afrika do not participate in class while on their period. This makes 20% of a schoolyear. The reason is complex, but one factor is the lack of available sanitary products, terrible hygienic conditions and poverty.</p>
                   <p>In 2017, over 100 000 people in developing countries did not go to school for several days during their period. This is due to the pricing and lack of period products and unsafe hygienic conditions in their communities.</p>
                    <p>Pupils with periods enrollment and attendance in school plays a large part in global development. Child birth due to lack of education is unfortunately a common thing. Larger families means more money spent, and the children get trapped in a never-ending cycle by having more children. </p>
<p>The best way to prevent this is to stay in school. For each year menstruating pupils stay in school, their first child is delayed by 10 months. Not only does this decrease childbirth drastically and reduce the amount of deaths during labor, but it will also make them feel more empowered and have a better chance at thriving.</p>
