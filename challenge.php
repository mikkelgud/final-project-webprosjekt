                    <p>Menstruation is one of the most natural things a human can experience. People all over the world has it, and still, it is a globally stigmatized issue. Actually, the origin of the word 'taboo' traces back from the Polynesian word “taupa”, which means menstrual blood. </p>
                    <p> 1 in 10 menstruating pupils in Africa do not participate in class while on their period. This makes 20% of a schoolyear. The reason is complex, but one factor is the lack of available sanitary products, terrible hygienic conditions and poverty.</p>
                    <q>At its worst, there are no toilets at all. In some schools, there may only be a small room where there is only a hole in the floor.</q>

                    <p>The Orange Rooms ultimate goal is to ensure that more people finish their education, by developing solutions for keeping pupils in class while menstruating.</p>
                    <q>The sanitary conditions for pupils, especially in puberty, is a major obstacle and pupils even stop attending school because of this.</q>

                    <p>Education plays a large part in global development. If more people finish their education, these might be some of the positive consequences:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduced number of unwanted child births</li>
                        <li>Smaller families</li>
                        <li>More equality between the genders</li>
